                <p>
                    I was a highwayman. Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive.</p>

                <p>I was a sailor. I was born upon the tide
                    And with the sea I did abide.
                    I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
                    I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
                    And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
                    But I am living still.</p>

                <p>I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide
                    Where steel and water did collide
                    A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
                    I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
                    They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
                    But I am still around.I'll always be around.and around and around and
                    Around and around</p>

                <p>
                    I fly a starship across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again
