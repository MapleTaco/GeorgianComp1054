                <p>
                    I was a highwayman. Along the coach roads I did ride
                    With sword and pistol by my side
                    Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
                    Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
                    The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
                    But I am still alive.</p>
                <p>
                    I was a sailor. I was born upon the tide
                    And with the sea I did abide.
                    I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
                    I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
                    And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
                    But I am living still.</p>
                <p>
                    I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide
                    Where steel and water did collide
                    A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
                    I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
                    They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
                    But I am still around.I'll always be around.and around and around and
                    Around and around</p>
                <p>
                    I fly a starship across the Universe divide
                    And when I reach the other side
                    I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
                    Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
                    Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
                    But I will remain
                    And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again
                </p>

                    <h5>About the song</h5>
                    <p>
                        Originally written by singer-songwriter Jimmy Webb, the song talks about
                        a particular soul incarnating in four different places. The song was
                        influenced by the real life highwayman Jonathan Wild.

                    <h5>About the band</h5>
                    <p>
                        <em>The Highwaymen</em> were an American country music supergroup consisting of
                        Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson. 
                        The naming came from the very same song when Glenn Campbell played it
                        in front of all 4 of them. They thought the name <em>The Highwaymen</em>
                        was fitting since they were always on the road.
